# ANALYSEZ-LES-VENTES-D-UNE-LIBRAIRIE-AVEC-PYTHON
This repository contains data analysis work conducted for Lapage, a company that originally operated as a physical bookstore with multiple retail locations. Due to the growing success of certain products and increasing customer demand, Lapage expanded into e-commerce by launching an online bookstore two years ago.
The analysis will be divided into two main parts:

Sales Analysis: Requested by Antoine, the Business Analyst, focusing on key sales indicators to guide strategic decisions such as pricing adjustments, offer creation, and customer targeting.
Customer Behavior Analysis: Aimed at understanding online customer behavior to compare it with insights from the physical stores. This analysis will help tailor marketing strategies and improve customer engagement. Julie, the Business Intelligence Analyst, will provide further details on this aspect.
